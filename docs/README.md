# QUIZLY
### Around the World Trivia
***
*Developed by Paula De Amicis*

Code Institute's Milestone Project 2 is the culmination of the successful completion of all HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript modules nested within the Front-end Development journey. 
Designed to demonstrate competency in the three fundamental coding and programming languages and creativity in the choice of quiz.

### DESIGN

#### COLOUR PALETTE 
Consistent across all devices, the colour palette was inspired by our big, blue sky and passenger air travel, so shades of blue, grey and white were used.

Responses to answers were inspired by the universal traffic light system, with colours green for correct and red for incorrect.

#### TYPOGRAPHY
Google Fonts are incorporated into the website. **Ysabeau Office** for the heading and sub-headings and **Poppins** for all other scales with a standard sans serif fallback. These styles were selected to reflect the _fun_ aspect of the game while also being legible and clear. 

#### STRUCTURE
Designed to be quick to learn and easy to navigate, Quizly is a single-page website. When a player visits the website, they are greeted with a Welcome message on the landing page. The user clicks a button to enter the quiz, they are then given the option to select their level of difficulty. At this point, the quiz has further navigational features; return to home or help for more information. Once the player has answered all the questions in their chosen level of difficulty, they will be presented with the number of correct responses and the corresponding award (Gold, Silver, Bronze or Try again) and the option to play again, which once clicked, will return them to the home page. 

#### PROTOTYPES
Wireframes, concept prototypes and user journeys were mapped out using [Figma](https://www.figma.com "Figma home").

## TESTING
All code validated via the [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to detect errors and potential problems in the code. 

I chose to use multiple JavaScript files, each designed to provide functionality for specific features, to organise and modularise particular processes. As a result, I encountered some difficulties with referencing and parsing the scripts and a troublesome CORS error. After a series of debugging efforts, I realised I needed to run the program in a node.js environment. After installing node.js and a range of relevant packages, the CORS error disappeared, and I was able to proceed with improving the game's functionality.

#### LIGHTHOUSE TESTING 
The website was tested for: 
- Performance - how the page performs while loading
- Accessibility - meets accessibility standards so that it works equally for everyone and provides tips on improvement where relevant
- Best practice - conforms to current industry best practice standards
- SEO - Search engine optimisation. Ranks the site

#### MANUAL TESTING
Throughout development, I carried out a range of manual testing to ensure functionality was as intended. 

These included: 

* Landing page
    *   Page loads correctly
    *   User can clearly see and interact with the site; button states change from active to hover to clicked.
    *   Clicking the 'Let's go!' button will start the game and direct the user to the next section - Choosing the level of difficulty. 

* Navigation 
    * Click the home icon to reload the website
    * Question mark icon will trigger a modal with game rules
    * Triggered modal has a cross icon to close, and it works

* Difficulty section
    * Clicking either 'easy' or 'hard' will load the respective questions in a randomised order each time. 

* Question section 
    * Questions and answer options are displayed correctly
    * Answer options are enabled once the question has loaded
    * Question counter increments correctly with each question answered
    * Selected answer will trigger the appropriate colour change to the button (red = incorrect and green = correct)
    * 'Next Question' icon is disabled until the user has submitted an answer
    * 'Next Question' icon enabled after the answer submitted
    * Once the 'next question' icon has been clicked, the next question will be correctly loaded and continue until all 10 questions have been answered. 
    * When all questions for the section have been answered, the results section will be triggered. 

*   Results section 
    *   Section is rendered correctly 
    *   Questions answered correctly are counted in the back end and presented as a total to the user with the                 appropriate tribute and award icon
    *   Verify that the 'play again' button is enabled and will work as intendedâ€”to reload the website and direct the user to the home page. 

#### BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
This website has been manually tested on the browsers listed below, with additional testing via Lighthouse. 
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox

#### BUGS
The majority of the bugs were syntax errors and not calling the correct element within the functions. I also needed to refactor the logic to improve clarity, remove any redundancies, bloat and modularise for simplicity. CORS error was a major stumbling block until I ran the program in a node.js environment.
